          You heard that right. Orbitrix is developing robot dogs. Not importing them. Not assembling kits. Actually designing and building them from scratch. Metal frame, motors, sensors, artificial intelligence—everything. Built here.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Yes. Robot dogs. Four-legged machines that walk, run, navigate obstacles, and respond to commands. The kind you see in viral videos from tech companies with billion-dollar budgets. Except these ones are being built in a workshop in Lagos by Nigerian engineers who apparently didn’t get the memo that this was supposed to be impossible.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          And before you ask: Yes, they actually work.
        </p>
        
        <p className='font-outfit mt-6 text-[17px]'>
          How Did This Even Happen?
        </p>

       <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-2 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
         It started with a question that sounded ridiculous: “Can we build a robotic dog?” Most people would’ve laughed and moved on. The Orbitrix engineering team apparently heard “challenge accepted.”
       </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Nobody expected it to work. Robot dogs are Boston Dynamics territory—the kind of technology that requires decades of research, millions in funding, and teams of specialists with PhDs. Not something you build in Nigeria with determination and Nigerian engineering ingenuity. Except that’s exactly what Orbitrix did.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Months of design iterations. Failed prototypes that face-planted during testing. Motors that overheated. Code that crashed. Joints that couldn’t handle the weight. Every problem that could go wrong did go wrong. And every single time, the Orbitrix team figured it out, fixed it, and kept building.
        </p>

        <img src="/robot-dogs2.jpg" className="mt-8 w-full" />

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Then one day, the robot dog stood up on its own four legs. Everyone in the workshop froze. It took a step. Then another. Then it walked across the floor like it had been doing it for years.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Someone actually cried. Because right there, walking on four mechanical legs, was proof that Nigerian engineers can build anything if you stop telling them they can’t.
        </p>
        
        <p className='font-outfit mt-6 text-[17px]'>
          What Can This Thing Actually Do?
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-2 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          The Orbitrix robot dog isn’t a toy. It’s not a showpiece that looks cool but can’t handle real work. This is an industrial platform being developed for serious applications.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          It navigates obstacles autonomously. Place something in its path, and it calculates a route around it without being told. Uneven ground? It adjusts its gait and keeps moving. Stairs? The Orbitrix team is working on that next. The goal isn’t just to make it walk—it’s to make it go anywhere.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          It responds to voice commands. Sit. Stand. Turn. Move forward. The robot dog processes the commands and executes them. Future versions will handle more complex instructions as the Orbitrix team refines the AI systems controlling its behavior.
        </p>

        <img src="/robot-dogs.jpg" className="mt-8 w-full" />

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          It’s being designed for real applications. Security patrols in areas humans can’t easily monitor. Industrial site inspections in hazardous environments. Search and rescue operations where four-legged mobility works better than wheeled robots. Research platforms for testing autonomous navigation and AI decision-making.
        </p>

        <p className='font-outfit mt-6 text-[17px]'>
          Why Is Orbitrix Even Building This?
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-2 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Fair question. Why would a Nigerian aerospace company invest time and resources into building robot dogs?
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Because Orbitrix isn’t just building products—we’re building capability. Every impossible project we complete teaches us something new about precision engineering, autonomous systems, AI development, and manufacturing complex robotics. The robot dog isn’t the endpoint. It’s proof of what’s possible when Nigerian engineers tackle challenges everyone says are beyond our reach.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          If Orbitrix can build a robot dog that walks, what else can we build? Robotic arms for manufacturing? Autonomous inspection platforms? Orbital systems for space operations? Every project expands what we know how to do, what we’re capable of building, what problems we can solve.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          The robot dog walking around the Orbitrix facility today represents the foundation for tomorrow’s more ambitious projects. It’s not about the dog itself—it’s about proving we have the engineering depth to build advanced robotic systems from scratch.
        </p>

          The Reaction When People See It
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-2 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Visitors to Orbitrix have a predictable reaction when they see the robot dog. First, stunned silence. They watch it walk, process what they’re seeing, and their brain struggles to reconcile “robot dog” with “built in Nigeria.”
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Then come the questions: “You actually built this? Here? How? Why didn’t anyone know you could do this?”
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          The answer is simple: We didn’t ask permission. We didn’t wait for someone to believe it was possible. We didn’t announce plans and wait for approval. Orbitrix just built it, tested it, refined it, and kept improving it until it worked.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Now it’s walking around our facility while people are still processing that it exists.
        </p>

        <img src="/robot-dogs.jpg" className="mt-8 w-full" />

        <p className='font-outfit mt-6 text-[17px]'>
          This Is Just the Beginning
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Here’s what people don’t realize: The robot dog is just one project. Orbitrix is simultaneously developing drones that fly for days, building hand-crafted industrial robots, launching logistics platforms, and working on atmospheric research systems. The robot dog gets attention because it’s unexpected and impressive, but it’s part of a larger picture.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          Orbitrix is building a portfolio of advanced technologies that nobody expected to see developed in Nigeria. Each project proves that Nigerian engineering can compete at the highest levels. Each successful build expands what we’re capable of tackling next.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          The robot dog walks. The drones fly for 80 hours. The logistics platforms deliver over traffic. The hand-made robots solve industrial problems. And people are still asking: “Wait, Orbitrix is doing all of this? Here? In Nigeria?”Yes. All of it. Here. In Nigeria.
        </p>

        <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
          And we’re just getting started.
        </p>

        <p className='font-outfit italic font-bold mt-6 text-[13px]'>
          Orbitrix doesn’t just talk about innovation. We build it, make it walk, and watch people’s minds change when they see it.
        </p>

       <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
         Come see the robot dog. Watch it walk. Then ask yourself what else is possible when Nigerian engineers decide “impossible” is just another engineering challenge.
