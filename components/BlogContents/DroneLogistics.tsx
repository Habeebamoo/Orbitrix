        Your delivery rider just called. He’s stuck in traffic. Again. The customer is calling asking where their package is. Again. You’re apologizing for delays caused by Lagos roads. Again.
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        What if your packages could just fly over the traffic?

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        Orbitrix is building drones specifically for logistics companies. Not someday. Right now. Industrial drones that carry your packages while your competitors sit in gridlock wondering why their deliveries are always late.

        The Problem Everyone in Logistics Knows
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-2 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
      You promise same-day delivery. Your rider leaves immediately. Then reality hits—go-slow on Third Mainland Bridge, standstill traffic on Lekki-Epe, impossible congestion everywhere. Hours wasted. Fuel burned while not moving. Customers lost because you can’t deliver on time.
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        Everyone in logistics has this exact problem. You can’t fix Lagos traffic. But Orbitrix can help you fly over it.

        What Orbitrix Built
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-2 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        Orbitrix logistics drones carry five kilograms—enough for most urgent deliveries. Documents, medications, spare parts, e-commerce packages. The drone flies autonomously from your warehouse to the customer. No pilot needed. No traffic to fight. Just direct flight that takes minutes instead of hours.
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        Victoria Island delivery from Ikeja? Eighteen minutes by Orbitrix drone while motorcycles are still stuck at the first junction. Hospital needs urgent medical supplies? Fifteen minutes instead of two hours. Factory needs a spare part before production stops? Delivered before they finish calculating downtime costs.
      </p>

        This isn’t imported technology. Orbitrix engineers built these drones in Nigeria, for Nigerian conditions, solving Nigerian logistics problems.

        What This Means For Your Business
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-2 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        One Orbitrix drone handles multiple deliveries per hour because it doesn’t sit in traffic. You can finally offer guaranteed 30-minute delivery windows that you actually meet. That’s premium pricing. That’s customer loyalty. That’s competitive advantage your competitors can’t match while they’re still using motorcycles
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        Your costs drop. No fuel price fluctuations. No paying riders to sit in traffic. No vehicle repairs from potholes. Just reliable drone delivery that works every time.
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        Your customers are happy because you actually deliver when you said you would. No more “five minutes away” for the next hour. No more missed windows. Just packages arriving on time, every time.

        ORBITRIX GENUINE CONVICTION

        Your Competitor Is Reading This Too
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-2 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        Some logistics company is looking at this right now thinking: “We should be the first to offer drone delivery in our market.” They’re imagining the marketing advantage, the customers they’ll win, the premium pricing they can charge.
      </p>

      <p className='font-jsl text-gray-600 mt-6 text-[15px] leading-[26px]'>
        That company could be you. Or your competitor.

        Orbitrix drones work. The technology is ready. Logistics companies are already asking when they can start.

        Traffic will be terrible tomorrow. Your riders will still get delayed. Your customers will still be frustrated.
